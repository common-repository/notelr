= When do I get paid? =

At the end of each month Notelr will process all the payments received and transfer you your revenue share, through PayPal.

**Note:** In order to ensure processing efficiency, Notelr only submits payouts of $20 or more. This means that if you did not accumulate a minimum of $20 in a certain month, Notelr will hold your balance and add it to next month’s payout.

1. EPC is a very important number for you to keep track of, as it lets you understand how much Notelr will be able to pay you based on the income all your widgets generated.
2. EPC is calculated based on traffic, number of purchases, value of purchases, amount of partners, type of partners, etc.
3. EPC is updated at the end of each month and available on your Stats Page.

= Notelr Do’s & Don’ts =


**Don’t misuse the widgets**

The Notelr team believes that bloggers should be able to define what kinds of widgets are valuable to their readers. If you recommend a restaurant, a service, or your favorite kitchen utensil, it’s because you truly find it relevant to your content and valuable to your readers.

**Write original content**

As a community of writers, Notelr takes writers’ intellectual property very seriously. We adopted a policy of zero tolerance against copyright infringement. It is Notelr policy to terminate access to the notelr.com website and earning services by those users who infringe copyright materials. See the Copyright Policy page to learn more.

**No hidden agendas. Period.**

To sustain a healthy community of writers we must, in turn, be accountable to them. We proudly adopted a rigid internal policy of openness and transparency. On your Stats page you can access a simple and straightforward tracking mechanism that shows you exactly how your earnings were calculated. If you want to know something that is not accessible, please let us know. We are committed to ensure it is corrected ASAP.
